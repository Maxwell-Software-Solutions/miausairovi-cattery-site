## 🔒 Privacy & Best Practices

- **Console Logging**: See what's being tracked in browser console

### Optional (For GDPR Compliance)
If you need cookie consent:
1. Add cookie consent banner
2. Only initialize GA after user accepts cookies
3. Add privacy policy page explaining data collection

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
- [ ] **Verify tracking works** - Check Real-Time report in GA dashboard
- [ ] **Test contact form** - Submit a test inquiry and verify event appears in GA

### This Week
- [ ] **Set up conversion goal**: Mark "Form Submit" as a conversion in GA
- [ ] **Create custom report**: Track "Contact Form Funnel" (visits → contact page → submit)
- [ ] **Review data**: Check which pages are most popular

### Optional Enhancements

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any data in GA"
- **Wait 24-48 hours** for data to populate
- **Use Real-Time report** for immediate feedback
- **Check console logs** to verify GA is initialized

### "GA is not tracking in development"
- **This is expected!** GA is disabled in dev mode
- **To enable**: Create `.env.local` file with `VITE_FORCE_GA=true`

### "I see duplicate page views"
- **Clear browser cache** and hard reload
- **Check App.tsx**: Ensure `initializeGA()` only called once
