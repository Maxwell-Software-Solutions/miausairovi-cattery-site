## üí° Lessons Learned

Key takeaways from the implementation (preserved here):

1. **Start with GitHub mode** - Local mode adds complexity
2. **Use correct imports** - `@keystatic/core/ui` for React SPAs
3. **Two-layer auth** - AuthGuard + GitHub OAuth works well
4. **Prebuild process** - Generate JSON at build time for performance
5. **Good planning pays off** - Detailed plan made implementation smooth
