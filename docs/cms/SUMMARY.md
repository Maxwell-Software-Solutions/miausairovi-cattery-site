## What Keystatic Solves

### Current Pain Points

‚ùå **Content editing requires coding** (TypeScript knowledge)
‚ùå **Only developers can update content**

### After Keystatic

‚úÖ **Visual admin interface** (no coding needed)
‚úÖ **Anyone can edit content** (user-friendly forms)
‚úÖ **Real-time preview** in editor
‚úÖ **Drag-and-drop image upload**
‚úÖ **Self-service content updates**

## Content You Can Manage

After implementation, these become editable via visual admin:

### Collections (Multiple Items)

1. **Cats** - Breeding cats with galleries
2. **Kittens** - Available kittens with status
3. **Reviews** - Customer testimonials
4. **FAQs** - Questions and answers

### Singletons (Single Items)

1. **Homepage Content** - Hero and features
