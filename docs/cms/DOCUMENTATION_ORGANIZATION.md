# CMS Documentation - Organization Guide

## üìÅ Current Structure

The CMS documentation has been reorganized after successful implementation completion.

---

## ‚úÖ Active Documentation (Keep & Use)

These files are current and should be referenced regularly:

### Essential Guides
- **CMS_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Complete implementation status and checklist
- **FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Roadmap for future enhancements
- **HOW_TO_USE_KEYSTATIC.md** - Daily usage guide for content editors
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture overview
- **KEYSTATIC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick command reference
- **AUTH_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Authentication guide

### Setup Documents
- **../setup/KEYSTATIC_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md** - Production deployment guide

---

## üì¶ Archived Documentation (Historical Reference)

These files document the planning and implementation process. They can be moved to an `archive/` folder but kept for historical reference:

### Planning Documents
- **KEYSTATIC_MIGRATION_PLAN.md** - Original implementation plan (completed)
- **KEYSTATIC_DECISION_GUIDE.md** - Decision framework (decision made)
- **SUMMARY.md** - Original documentation summary

### Issue Resolution
- **KEYSTATIC_FIX_JSON_ERROR.md** - JSON API error resolution (resolved)
- **KEYSTATIC_LOCAL_MODE_ISSUE.md** - Local mode issues (resolved)

### Implementation Records
- **AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Auth implementation record
- **KEYSTATIC_AUTHENTICATION.md** - Detailed auth documentation

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Recommended File Organization

### Option 1: Keep Current Structure
Keep all files in `docs/cms/` for easy reference. This is fine if you don't mind seeing archived docs.

### Option 2: Archive Old Files

```bash
# Create archive folder
mkdir docs/cms/archive

# Move completed planning docs
mv docs/cms/KEYSTATIC_MIGRATION_PLAN.md docs/cms/archive/
mv docs/cms/KEYSTATIC_DECISION_GUIDE.md docs/cms/archive/
mv docs/cms/SUMMARY.md docs/cms/archive/
mv docs/cms/KEYSTATIC_FIX_JSON_ERROR.md docs/cms/archive/
mv docs/cms/KEYSTATIC_LOCAL_MODE_ISSUE.md docs/cms/archive/
mv docs/cms/AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md docs/cms/archive/
mv docs/cms/KEYSTATIC_AUTHENTICATION.md docs/cms/archive/
```

**Result:**

```

- Update `HOW_TO_USE_KEYSTATIC.md` if UI changes

### After New Features
- Add to `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (planning phase)
- Move to `CMS_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (after implementation)
- Update `HOW_TO_USE_KEYSTATIC.md` (usage guide)

### Annually
- Review `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` and reprioritize
- Update `CMS_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` with stats
- Archive obsolete documentation
