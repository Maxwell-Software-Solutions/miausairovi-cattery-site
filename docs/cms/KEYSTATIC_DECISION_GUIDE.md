# Keystatic CMS: Decision Guide

## Executive Summary

This document helps you decide whether to migrate to Keystatic CMS and understand what you're getting into.

## TL;DR - Should You Migrate?

**✅ Yes, if you:**

- Want non-developers to update content easily
- Need frequent content updates (kittens, reviews)
- Want a visual editor with preview
- Value Git-based version control
- Want to avoid recurring CMS costs

**⚠️ Maybe, if you:**

- Updates are very infrequent (monthly or less)
- Only developers edit content
- Team is comfortable with TypeScript
- Happy with current workflow

**❌ No, if you:**

- Content almost never changes
- No budget for 20+ hours implementation
- Need advanced CMS features (multi-language, workflows)
- Prefer a traditional database-backed CMS

## Current vs. Keystatic Comparison

### Content Editing

| Aspect | Current (TypeScript) | With Keystatic |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Who can edit** | Developers only | Anyone (visual editor) |
| **Editor** | VS Code / any text editor | Web-based admin UI |
| **Learning curve** | High (need TypeScript) | Low (form-based) |

### Cost Analysis

| Item | Current | With Keystatic |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **CMS license** | Free | Free (open-source) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel/Netlify free tier | Same |
| **Database** | $0 | $0 |

## Use Cases

### Perfect For

#### 1. Kitten Availability Updates

**Current workflow:**

```typescript
// Edit src/data/kittens.data.ts
{
  id: 5,
  name: 'Kitten 5',
  status: KittenStatus.Available, // Change to Sold
}
```

- Need developer
- Need code review
- Need deployment
- **Time**: 15-30 minutes

**Keystatic workflow:**

1. Open `/keystatic/kittens/kitten-5`
2. Change status dropdown to "Sold"
3. Click Save
4. Commit & push

- No developer needed
- Self-service
- **Time**: 2 minutes

#### 2. Adding New Reviews

**Current workflow:**

```typescript
// Edit src/data/reviews.data.ts
export const reviewsData: Review[] = [
  // ... existing reviews
  {
    id: 11,
    name: 'New Customer',
    rating: 5,
    date: 'October 2024',
    comment: 'Great experience!',
    platform: 'Facebook',
  },
];
```

- Edit array
- Update IDs
- Format correctly
- **Time**: 10-15 minutes

**Keystatic workflow:**

1. Open `/keystatic/reviews`
2. Click "Create Review"
3. Fill form (auto-validated)
4. Click Save

- Form prevents errors
- No ID management
- **Time**: 3 minutes

#### 3. Content Updates for Non-Developers

**Current**: Impossible without developer assistance

**Keystatic**: Fully self-service with admin UI

### Not Ideal For

#### 1. Single Annual Update

If you only update content once a year, the 20-hour implementation cost may not be worth it.

#### 2. Complex Custom Logic

If your content requires complex TypeScript transformations or computed properties, plain Keystatic might not be sufficient (though you can add custom logic).

#### 3. Real-Time Collaboration

Multiple people editing the same file simultaneously could cause Git conflicts (though this is rare with proper workflow).

## Migration Effort Breakdown

### Time Investment

| Phase | Hours | Difficulty | Can Skip? |
|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Setup & Config | 2-3 | Easy | No |
| Content Migration | 3-4 | Medium | No |
| Data Layer | 2-3 | Medium | No |
| Component Updates | 3-4 | Medium | No |
| Build Process | 2 | Easy | No |
| Dev Workflow | 1 | Easy | No |
| GitHub Integration | 2 | Medium | Yes (optional) |
| Testing | 2-3 | Easy | No |
| Deployment | 1-2 | Easy | No |
| **Total** | **18-24** | **Medium** | **GitHub optional** |

### Difficulty Assessment

**Easy phases** (≤2 hours, straightforward):

- Setup: Install packages, copy config
- Build process: Copy build scripts
- Dev workflow: Update npm scripts
- Deployment: Push to existing host

**Medium phases** (3-4 hours, requires thinking):

- Content migration: Write conversion scripts
- Data layer: Create reader functions
- Component updates: Refactor data access
- Testing: Comprehensive validation

**No hard phases!** This is a well-documented, straightforward migration.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | Low | High | Backup before starting |
| Components break | Medium | Medium | Test phase-by-phase |
| Build fails | Low | Medium | Validate content before build |
| Performance regression | Very Low | Low | Static generation = same speed |
| Content structure issues | Low | Medium | Use validation scripts |

## Decision Matrix

Rate each factor for your situation (1-5, where 5 = most important):

| Factor | Weight | Current Score | With Keystatic | Weighted Diff |
|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Ease of editing | __ | 2 | 5 | __ |
| Developer time saved | __ | 3 | 5 | __ |
| Content update frequency | __ | varies | varies | __ |
| Non-tech user access | __ | 1 | 5 | __ |
| Implementation cost | __ | 5 | 2 | __ |
| Maintenance burden | __ | 4 | 4 | __ |
| Type safety | __ | 5 | 5 | __ |
| Performance | __ | 5 | 5 | __ |

**How to use:**

1. Fill in weights (1-5) based on importance to you
2. Calculate weighted differences
3. If total is positive, migrate
4. If negative, stay with current approach

## Recommendation by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Active Cattery (Frequent Updates)

**Profile:**

- Multiple litters per year
- Frequent kitten status changes
- Regular review additions
- Owner wants to update content themselves

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Migrate to Keystatic**

**Why**: The time saved on each update will quickly pay back the implementation cost. Self-service capability is valuable.

---

### Scenario 2: Established Cattery (Moderate Updates)

**Profile:**

- 1-2 litters per year
- Occasional content updates
- Comfortable with current workflow
- Developer available for changes

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Consider carefully**

**Why**: Benefits are moderate. Evaluate if self-service editing is worth 20 hours of dev time.

---

### Scenario 3: Showcase Site (Rare Updates)

**Profile:**

- Static breeding cats
- Infrequent updates
- Content set and forget
- Low maintenance priority

**Recommendation**: ❌ **Stay with current approach**

**Why**: Implementation cost not justified for rare updates. Current approach is fine.

---

### Scenario 4: Growing Business

**Profile:**

- Expanding cattery
- Planning to hire non-technical staff
- Want to scale content operations
- Future-proofing

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Migrate to Keystatic**

**Why**: Investment in scalable content management pays off as business grows.

## Alternative Solutions

If Keystatic doesn't fit, consider:

### 1. Keep Current Approach + Improve

**Improvements:**

- Create helper scripts for common tasks
- Add better TypeScript docs for editing
- Use JSON instead of TypeScript (easier to edit)

**Pros**: No migration needed
**Cons**: Still requires developer for changes

### 2. Use Airtable + API

**How**: Content in Airtable, fetch via API

**Pros**: Easy non-tech editing, familiar interface
**Cons**: External dependency, API calls, costs

### 3. Traditional Headless CMS

**Options**: Contentful, Strapi, Sanity

**Pros**: Feature-rich, established, great UIs
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, monthly costs, complexity

### 4. Markdown Files + GitHub UI

**How**: Teach users to edit .md files on GitHub

**Pros**: Simple, no implementation
**Cons**: GitHub UI not great, Git knowledge needed

## Making the Decision

### Questions to Ask

1. **How often do we update content?**
   - Daily/Weekly: Strong case for Keystatic
   - Monthly: Moderate case
   - Rarely: Weak case

2. **Who needs to edit content?**
   - Non-developers: Strong case for Keystatic
   - Only devs: Moderate case
   - External users: Very strong case

3. **What's our 2-year plan?**
   - Growing: Strong case (scales with you)
   - Stable: Moderate case
   - Shrinking: Weak case

4. **Do we have 20 hours for implementation?**
   - Yes, available now: Go for it
   - Yes, but later: Wait for better timing
   - No: Don't start

5. **Budget for development?**
   - Paid time available: Go ahead
   - Volunteer time: Consider carefully
   - No time at all: Stay with current

### Red Flags (Don't Migrate If)

🚩 Content updates less than once per quarter
