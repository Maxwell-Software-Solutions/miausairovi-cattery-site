# Google Search Console Setup Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide will walk you through connecting your website (miausairovi.com) to Google Search Console. This is a **critical step** for SEO as it allows Google to:
- Discover and index your pages
- Monitor your site's search performance
- Alert you to technical issues
- Show you which keywords drive traffic

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- Your website must be deployed and live at `https://miausairovi.com`
- You need a Google account
- You should have access to your domain registrar or Vercel deployment settings

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access Google Search Console

1. Go to: **https://search.google.com/search-console**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Add property"** or **"Start now"**

---

### Step 2: Choose Verification Method

You'll see two options:

#### **Option A: Domain Property** (Recommended - Covers all subdomains)
- Enter: `miausairovi.com`
- This verifies ALL versions: www, https, http, subdomains

#### **Option B: URL Prefix** (Easier but less comprehensive)
- Enter: `https://miausairovi.com`
- This only verifies the exact URL entered

**üí° Recommendation:** Choose **Domain Property** for comprehensive coverage.

---

### Step 3: Verify Ownership

Google offers multiple verification methods. Choose the one that works best for you:

---

#### **Method 1: HTML Meta Tag** (Easiest for Vercel/React)

1. Google will give you a meta tag that looks like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE" />
   ```

2. **Add this tag to your `index.html` file:**

   Open `c:\Projects\miausairovi-cattery-site\index.html` and add the meta tag in the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE" />
     <!-- Rest of your meta tags -->
   ```

3. **Commit and deploy to Vercel:**
   ```powershell
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification meta tag"
   git push
   ```

4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel to deploy

5. **Return to Google Search Console** and click **"Verify"**

‚úÖ **Done!** This is the simplest method for your setup.

---

#### **Method 2: HTML File Upload** (Alternative)

1. Google provides a file like `google1234567890abcdef.html`
2. Download this file
3. Place it in: `c:\Projects\miausairovi-cattery-site\public\`
4. Commit and deploy:
   ```powershell
   git add public/google*.html
   git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification file"
   git push
   ```
5. After deployment, click **"Verify"** in Google Search Console

---

#### **Method 3: DNS Verification** (Most Reliable, but requires domain access)

1. Google provides a TXT record like:
   ```
   google-site-verification=1234567890abcdef
   ```

2. **Add this to your domain DNS settings:**
   - Log in to your domain registrar (where you bought miausairovi.com)
   - Go to DNS settings
   - Add a new **TXT record**:
     - **Name/Host:** `@` or leave blank
     - **Value:** `google-site-verification=YOUR_CODE`
     - **TTL:** 3600 (or default)

3. **Save changes** (DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours)

4. Return to Google Search Console and click **"Verify"**

üí° **This method remains valid even if you change hosting providers.**

---

#### **Method 4: Google Analytics** (If you already have GA)

If you already have Google Analytics set up on your site:
1. Ensure you're signed in with the same Google account
2. Select **"Google Analytics"** verification method
3. Click **"Verify"**

---

### Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap

Once verified, immediately submit your sitemap:

1. In Google Search Console, click **"Sitemaps"** in the left menu
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**

Google will now start crawling and indexing your pages!
