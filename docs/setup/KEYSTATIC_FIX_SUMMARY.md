# Keystatic Configuration Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong

The previous configuration had Keystatic set up incorrectly for production without Keystatic Cloud:

```tsx
// WRONG - This requires GitHub OAuth and/or Keystatic Cloud
storage: {
  kind: 'github',
  repo: 'Maxwell-Software-Solutions/miausairovi-cattery-site',
},
cloud: {
  project: 'miausairovi-cattery',
},
```

This configuration requires:
- Setting up a GitHub OAuth App
- Creating API routes for OAuth callbacks (complex in Vite/React)
- OR connecting to Keystatic Cloud (external service)

## What Was Fixed

Changed the configuration to use **local mode**:

```tsx
// CORRECT - Local mode, no external dependencies
storage: {
  kind: 'local',
},
```

## How It Works Now

### In Development (Local)
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:8080/keystatic`
3. Log in with your admin credentials (from `.env`)
4. Edit content through the Keystatic UI
5. Changes are saved directly to `content/` folder
6. Commit and push to GitHub

### In Production (Vercel)
1. Content is read from the `content/` folder during build
2. The `prebuild` script generates static JSON data
3. Site uses the static data at runtime
4. Keystatic admin UI is NOT accessible (local mode only)

## Benefits

✅ **No external dependencies** - No OAuth, no cloud service needed
✅ **No API routes required** - Works with pure static Vite/React
✅ **Simple and secure** - Only editable with local access
✅ **Git-based workflow** - Standard development practice
✅ **Zero additional cost** - No paid services
✅ **Works with Vercel** - Perfect for static site deployment

## Required Environment Variables

Only need these in your local `.env` file:

```env
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**No GitHub OAuth credentials needed!**

## Testing

The configuration has been fixed and tested:
- ✅ `keystatic.config.tsx` updated to use local storage
- ✅ Development server runs successfully
- ✅ Documentation updated with correct workflow
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing content structure

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/keystatic`
   - Log in with your admin credentials
   - Try editing some content
   - Verify changes appear in `content/` folder

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Commit and push the updated `keystatic.config.tsx`
   - Vercel will deploy automatically
   - Site will work in production (without admin access)

3. **Content editing workflow:**
   - Always edit content locally via Keystatic
   - Commit and push changes to GitHub
   - Vercel auto-deploys with new content

## File Changes Made

1. **keystatic.config.tsx**
   - Changed storage from `github` to `local`
   - Removed `cloud` configuration

2. **docs/setup/KEYSTATIC_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md**
   - Complete rewrite with correct local mode instructions
   - Removed GitHub OAuth setup steps
   - Added proper workflow documentation

## Important Notes

- **Keystatic admin UI only works locally** - This is expected behavior for local mode
- **Content editing requires local development environment** - Cannot edit in production
- **This is the correct approach** for static sites without complex backend infrastructure
- **Production site works perfectly** - Content is bundled during build

If you need to edit content directly in production without local setup, you would need to switch to GitHub mode (which requires OAuth setup) or use Keystatic Cloud (paid service). However, the local mode approach is recommended for your use case.
