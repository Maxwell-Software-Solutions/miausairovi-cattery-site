## What This Means

✅ **Your contact form is fully functional and ready to use!**

When customers submit the contact form:

2. You will receive the inquiry details at `vita.brasiunaite@gmail.com`
3. Both emails will be sent successfully

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Full Contact Form Flow

Start the development server and test the actual contact form:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Vercel dev (for serverless function)
vercel dev

# Terminal 2: Visit the contact page in your browser
# Fill out and submit the form
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Production

Deploy your site to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Then add these environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
- `MAILERSEND_API_KEY` = `mlsn.97acdf191fff57d9c55bef1f40dfce8adcfb0c7a3b6040f7c487bdc4033b7bc2`
- `MAILERSEND_FROM_EMAIL` = `MS_zrG5bU@test-65qngkd5w1dlwr12.mlsender.net`
- `MAILERSEND_TO_EMAIL` = `vita.brasiunaite@gmail.com`

## Important Notes

### Test Domain Email
You're currently using a MailerSend test domain email:
- `MS_zrG5bU@test-65qngkd5w1dlwr12.mlsender.net`

**For production**, you should:
1. Verify your own domain (miausairovi.com)
2. Update `MAILERSEND_FROM_EMAIL` to `info@miausairovi.com`
3. This will make emails look more professional and avoid spam filters

### Daily Quota
With your current plan:
- **100 emails per day**
- **10 emails per minute rate limit**

This is plenty for a cattery contact form!
