We breed British Shorthair, British Longhair, Scottish Fold, and Scottish Straight cats with a focus on health, temperament, and breed standard. Our cats are raised as part of our family in a home environment. We focus on producing well-socialized, healthy kittens with excellent temperaments. We limit the number of litters to ensure each cat and kitten receives individual attention and care.
