question: Are your kittens and breeding cats health tested?

Yes, absolutely. All our breeding cats are health tested for HCM (heart disease), PKD (kidney disease), and FeLV/FIV. Kittens are vet checked, vaccinated, microchipped, and come with health certificates. We prioritize the health and wellbeing of our cats above all else.
